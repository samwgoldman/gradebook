[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/samwgoldman/gradebook.png)](http://travis-ci.org/samwgoldman/gradebook)

The purpose of Gradebook is to be a mechanism by which I can learn and practice test-driven development with Rails 3.1.

The technologies I am using for testing:
* RSpec for unit and functional testing
* Cucumber for high-level user interaction testing
* CoverMe to guarantee 100% code coverage
* Spork to speed up my testing
